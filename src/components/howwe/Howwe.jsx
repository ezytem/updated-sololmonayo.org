          The NGO arm of the organization happens to be the mother of all. It is the heartbeat of the SolomonAyo brand.
          We are committed to helping the less privileged, giving scholarships to children, giveaways,
          and offering mentorship programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          S.A foundation is not linked to a manâ€™s gratification. We are a non-profit organization and do not try to build
          a name. Rather, the foundation yearns to see Christ glorified. We are passionate about helping people grow in all
          facets of life.
